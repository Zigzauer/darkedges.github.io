I had installed `babun` via `git bash` and it was working fine with `docker` except for when
I was trying to connect to a `bash` shell via a `run` command.

```bash
{ ~ }  Â» docker run -it forgerock/opendj /bin/bash
the input device is not a TTY.  If you are using mintty, try prefixing the command with 'winpty'
```

## How to fix

Seems that `winpty` is deployed in the home directory and so to solve the issue I had to add the following, just remember to use the correct path for your
version of docker.

```bash
alias docker="~/.winpty/winpty.exe /cygdrive/c/Program Files/Docker Toolbox/docker"
```
